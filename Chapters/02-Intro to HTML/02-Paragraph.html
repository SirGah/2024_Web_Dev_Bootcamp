<h3><i>Day 1</i></h3>
<p> - Wake up early in the morning, probably start your
    day when eeryone are still asleep. <br />
    Make it a daily routine.<br />
    Put on your rubber shoes and jacket and make a 15-30mins walk.<br /> 
    Do some stretching starting from your head to toes.<br />
    Before going back home, do a 10 mins slow paced jog, <br />
    just enough to warm your body and release those sweat.

<h3><p>After your quick warmup of the day, drink plenty of fluids
    to replace all you sweat. Prepare a well balanced breakfast, have some
veggies, a slice of meat for your protein, some fruits and a few carbs from
rice of potatoes.</p></h3>
